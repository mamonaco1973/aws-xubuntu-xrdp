# AWS Xubuntu XRDP Cloud Development Environment  

This project provides a **complete cloud-based Linux desktop development environment**
powered by **Xubuntu + XRDP**, **Mini-Active Directory**, and **Amazon EFS**.  
It is designed as a **universal dev workstation** that contains the full superset of
tools, dependencies, and configurations used across all build projects on my channel.

Instead of manually configuring a workstation for each tutorial, demo, or cloud
project, this solution automatically provisions:

1. **A Custom Xubuntu XRDP AMI (Packer)**
   - Preloaded with Chrome, Firefox (deb), VS Code, Docker, Remmina, Postman  
   - Includes all development tooling required across channel projects:  
     **Packer, Terraform, Docker CLI, AWS CLI v2, Azure CLI, Google Cloud CLI**  
   - Snap-free, clean, lightweight Xfce desktop  
   - XRDP fully configured with all required fixes and defaults  
   - Desktop/panel icons, terminal emulator defaults, `/etc/skel` customizations  

2. **A Mini Active Directory Domain (Terraform)**
   - Samba-based AD Domain Controller  
   - Domain users generated from a template with random passwords  
   - Central authentication for Linux and Windows clients  

3. **Domain-Joined Linux Desktop Servers (Terraform)**
   - Deploys multiple Xubuntu XRDP instances using the Packer-built AMI  
   - Automatically joins AD using cloud-init  
   - Consistent user profiles via `/etc/skel` provisioning  

4. **Amazon EFS for Persistent Home Directories**
   - Linux instances mount EFS via NFS  
   - Provides persistent, centralized, scalable home directories  
   - Perfect for multi-instance pools or demo clusters  

The result is a **disposable, reproducible, cloud-hosted Linux workstation** that
can be launched in minutes and used for **any build, automation, or cloud project**
featured on the channel.

## Prerequisites

* [An AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
* [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) 
* [Install Latest Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)

If this is your first time watching our content, we recommend starting with this video: [AWS + Terraform: Easy Setup](https://youtu.be/BCMQo0CB9wk). It provides a step-by-step guide to properly configure Terraform, Packer, and the AWS CLI.

## Download this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mamonaco1973/aws-xubuntu.git
cd aws-xubuntu
```

## Build the Code

Run [check_env](check_env.sh) to validate your environment, then run [apply](apply.sh) to provision the infrastructure.

```bash
develop-vm:~/aws-efs$ ./apply.sh
NOTE: Validating that required commands are found in your PATH.
NOTE: aws is found in the current PATH.
NOTE: terraform is found in the current PATH.
NOTE: All required commands are available.
NOTE: Checking AWS cli connection.

- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/random from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/random v3.7.1
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.89.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

### Build Results

When the deployment completes, the following resources are created:

- **Networking:**  
  - A dedicated VPC with public and private subnets  
  - Internet Gateway and optional NAT Gateway for controlled outbound access  
  - Route tables configured to support AD, EFS, and the Xubuntu XRDP servers  

- **Security & IAM:**  
  - Security groups for the domain controller, Linux desktop servers, Windows admin server, and EFS  
  - IAM roles and policies allowing EC2 instances to:  
    - Use AWS Secrets Manager to retrieve AD credentials  
    - Mount EFS via NFS  
    - Perform instance bootstrapping without exposing credentials  
  - AD administrator and autogenerated user credentials stored securely in **AWS Secrets Manager**  

- **Active Directory Server:**  
  - Ubuntu-based EC2 instance running Samba 4 as the Domain Controller and DNS server  
  - Configured Kerberos realm, DNS zone, and NetBIOS name  
  - Domain users generated from a template with randomized passwords and stored in Secrets Manager  

- **Amazon EFS:**  
  - Elastic File System deployed with mount targets across private subnets  
  - Security groups allowing NFS traffic (TCP/2049) from all XRDP servers  
  - Serves as shared home directory storage for all Linux desktop instances  

- **Packer-Built Xubuntu XRDP AMI:**  
  - Custom AMI containing:  
    - Xubuntu (XFCE), XRDP, Chrome, Firefox (deb), VS Code  
    - Development tools: **Packer, Terraform, Docker CLI, AWS CLI v2, Azure CLI, Google Cloud CLI**  
    - Remmina, Postman, and all channel-wide prerequisites  
  - `/etc/skel` configured for default desktop icons, terminal emulator, wallpaper  
  - All XRDP fixes applied (session startup, terminal defaults, untrusted launcher, etc.)  

- **Linux Desktop Instances (XRDP):**  
  - EC2 instances deployed from the custom AMI  
  - Automatically joined to Active Directory using credentials pulled from Secrets Manager  
  - Home directories served from EFS via NFS  
  - Ready-to-use cloud development desktops for any project on the channel  

- **Windows Admin Server (Optional):**  
  - Domain-joined Windows Server for running RSAT, ADUC, DNS tools  
  - Useful for validation, troubleshooting, and Windows-based demo scenarios

### Users and Groups

As part of this project, when the domain controller is provisioned, a set of sample **users** and **groups** are automatically created through Terraform-provisioned scripts running on the mini-ad server. These resources are intended for **testing and demonstration purposes**, showcasing how to automate user and group provisioning in a self-managed Active Directory environment.


#### Groups Created

| Group Name    | Group Category | Group Scope | gidNumber |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| mcloud-users  | Security       | Universal   | 10001     |
| india         | Security       | Universal   | 10002     |
| us            | Security       | Universal   | 10003     |
| linux-admins  | Security       | Universal   | 10004     |

#### Users Created and Group Memberships

| Username | Full Name   | uidNumber | gidNumber | Groups Joined                    |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| jsmith   | John Smith  | 10001     | 10001     | mcloud-users, us, linux-admins    |
| edavis   | Emily Davis | 10002     | 10001     | mcloud-users, us                  |
| rpatel   | Raj Patel   | 10003     | 10001     | mcloud-users, india, linux-admins |
| akumar   | Amit Kumar  | 10004     | 10001     | mcloud-users, india               |

#### Understanding `uidNumber` and `gidNumber` for Linux Integration

The **`uidNumber`** (User ID) and **`gidNumber`** (Group ID) attributes are critical when integrating **Active Directory** with **Linux systems**, particularly in environments where **SSSD** ([System Security Services Daemon](https://sssd.io/)) or similar services are used for identity management. These attributes allow Linux hosts to recognize and map Active Directory users and groups into the **POSIX** (Portable Operating System Interface) user and group model.


### Clean Up Infrastructure  

When you are finished testing, you can remove all provisioned resources with:  

```bash
./destroy.sh
```

This will use Terraform to delete the VPC, EC2 instances, IAM roles, security groups, and any other infrastructure created by the project. Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager will also be deleted unless retention policies are configured.
